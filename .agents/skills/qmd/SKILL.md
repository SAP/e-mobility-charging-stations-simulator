# QMD - Query Markdown Documents

## How search works

QMD searches local markdown collections: notes, docs, wikis, transcripts, and
project knowledge bases. Use it before web search when the answer may already be
in indexed local files.

The workflow is always:

1. Search for candidate documents.
2. Retrieve the full source with `qmd get` or `qmd multi-get`.
3. Answer from retrieved text, citing paths or docids.

Do not answer from snippets alone when the user needs facts, decisions, quotes,
or nuance. Snippets are only leads.

Typical loop:

```bash
qmd search "merchant reality support interviews" -n 5
# leads: #abc123 concepts/customer-proximity.md; #def432 sources/merchant-call.md
qmd multi-get "#abc123,#def432" --format md
```

**Default to structured `qmd query` with `intent:`, `lex:`, `vec:`, and `hyde:`
fields that you write yourself.** You are a better query expander than the
built-in model: you know the user's actual goal, the domain vocabulary, and the
nearby-but-wrong concepts to avoid. Do not just paste the user's words into
`qmd query "..."` and hope the expansion model guesses right — supply the
`intent:` and craft the lexical and semantic terms deliberately (see
[Pick the right search mode](#pick-the-right-search-mode)).

When reporting what you retrieved, a compact note is enough; do not paste whole
files unless needed:

```text
Retrieved:
- #abc123 concepts/customer-proximity.md
- #def432 sources/merchant-call.md
```

## Pick the right search mode

Use **BM25 lexical search** when you know exact words, titles, names, code
symbols, or rare phrases:

```bash
qmd search "cockpit OKR Goodhart" -n 10
qmd search '"AI Before Headcount"' -c concepts -n 5
```

Use **`qmd query` with structured fields** when the user describes an idea
indirectly, uses different wording than the source, or needs conceptual recall.
**This is the default mode — write the fields yourself rather than leaning on
query expansion.** Combine exact anchors with semantic recall:

```bash
qmd query $'intent: Find the concept note about metrics as instruments without letting OKRs replace judgment.\nlex: cockpit instruments OKR Goodhart metrics judgment\nvec: data informed not metric driven product judgment\nhyde: A concept note says metrics are useful like cockpit instruments, but leaders should remain data-informed rather than metric-driven because OKRs and dashboards can Goodhart product judgment.'
```

Structured query fields (you author each one — do not delegate this to the
expansion model):

- `intent:` states what you are trying to find **and what to avoid**. Always
  supply this. It steers ranking away from nearby-but-wrong concepts.
- `lex:` exact terms, aliases, titles, code symbols, and rare words you expect
  in the source. This is your own keyword expansion.
- `vec:` paraphrases the idea in natural language, in source-like wording.
- `hyde:` describes the document or answer that would satisfy the request.

You do not need all four every time, but you should almost always write at least
`intent:` plus one of `lex:`/`vec:`. A bare `qmd query "the user's sentence"`
throws away the context only you have and relies on the built-in expander to
reconstruct it — prefer the structured form.

If you genuinely have nothing to expand (a single rare token, a verbatim phrase),
that is a job for `qmd search`, not bare `qmd query`:

```bash
qmd query --format json --explain $'intent: ...\nlex: ...\nvec: ...'  # inspect ranking
```

If `qmd query` is slow or model/GPU setup fails, fall back to `qmd search` with
better lexical terms.

## Retrieve sources

Search results include docids like `#abc123` and `qmd://...` paths. Fetch them:

```bash
qmd get "#abc123"
qmd get qmd://concepts/ai-before-headcount.md
qmd multi-get "#abc123,#def432" --format md
qmd multi-get 'concepts/{ai-before-headcount.md,data-informed-not-metric-driven.md}' --format md
qmd multi-get 'sources/podcast-2025-*.md' -l 80
```

Use `multi-get` when comparing several hits or gathering context across pages.

### Output is line-numbered and carries the docid — cite both

`get` and `multi-get` are **line-numbered by default** and always print the
document's `#docid` and `qmd://` path. So `get` output looks like:

```text
qmd://concepts/note.md  #abc123
---

1: # Metrics as instruments
2:
3: Treat dashboards like cockpit instruments...
```

Cite the docid and exact line numbers in your answer, and use the numbers to ask
for the next slice. Pass `--no-line-numbers` only when you need raw content to
copy verbatim (e.g. reproducing a code block).

When you need to open or edit the underlying file (e.g. hand a path to `Read`,
`Edit`, or an editor), add `--full-path`. It replaces the `qmd://` URL + docid
header with the document's on-disk path, falling back to the canonical header if
the file no longer exists on disk:

```text
$ qmd get "#abc123" --full-path
/Users/you/notes/concepts/note.md
---

1: # Metrics as instruments
```

`--full-path` works the same way on `qmd search` and `qmd query`: result paths
become the file's on-disk path — `./`-prefixed relative path when the file is
inside `$PWD`, absolute realpath otherwise — and the per-result `#docid` is
dropped because the path is the identifier. The leading `./` is intentional so
the output is unambiguously a filesystem path and cannot be mistaken for a bare
collection-relative string. Default search/query output still uses `qmd://`
URIs; only opt into `--full-path` when you specifically need a path you can hand
to a non-QMD tool.

### Read line ranges with the `:from:count` suffix — never pipe through `sed`/`head`/`tail`

`qmd get` slices files itself. Use the suffix or flags; do **not** shell out to
`sed -n`, `head`, `tail`, or `awk` to pull a line range. Piping defeats docid
resolution, virtual-path lookups, line numbering, and the header, and it is
slower and more error-prone.

The most compact form is a `:from:count` suffix right on the path or docid —
prefer it:

```bash
qmd get "#abc123:120:40"                  # 40 lines starting at line 120
qmd get qmd://concepts/note.md:200:60     # lines 200–259
qmd get "#abc123:120"                      # from line 120 to end of file
qmd get "#abc123" --from 120 -l 40         # equivalent, using flags
```

Suffix and flags:

- `<path>:<from>:<count>` — start at line `<from>`, read `<count>` lines. **Best
  for reading around a search hit.**
- `<path>:<from>` — start at `<from>`, read to end of file.
- `--from <line>` / `-l <lines>` — flag equivalents. Explicit flags override the
  suffix, so `... :5:2 -l 1` reads 1 line.
- `--no-line-numbers` — drop the `N:` prefixes (line numbers are on by default).

Wrong: `qmd get "#abc123" | sed -n '120,160p'`
Right: `qmd get "#abc123:120:40"`

Search results include a `:line` anchor on each hit — feed it straight into
`qmd get path:line:<n>` to read a window around the match (line numbers in the
output will start at `line`).

## Discover what is indexed

```bash
qmd collection list
qmd ls
qmd status
```

Add collection filters when broad searches drift into the wrong corpus:

```bash
qmd search "headcount autonomous agents" -c concepts -n 10
qmd query "merchant support product reality" -c concepts -c sources -n 10
```

Omit `-c` to search everything.

## MCP Tool: `query`

When using the MCP server, prefer structured searches:

```json
{
  "searches": [
    { "type": "lex", "query": "cockpit OKR Goodhart" },
    { "type": "vec", "query": "data informed not metric driven product judgment" },
    {
      "type": "hyde",
      "query": "A concept note explains that metrics are useful as instruments, but leaders should not let OKRs or dashboards replace judgment."
    }
  ],
  "intent": "Find the concept note about using metrics as instruments without becoming metric-driven.",
  "collections": ["concepts"],
  "limit": 10
}
```

Query types:

- `lex` — BM25 keyword search. Best for exact terms, names, titles, and code.
- `vec` — vector semantic search. Best for natural-language concepts.
- `hyde` — vector search using a hypothetical answer/document passage.

## Query craft

Good QMD searches mix three things:

1. **Title/alias anchors:** exact page titles, named entities, phrases.
2. **Semantic paraphrase:** how a human would describe the idea.
3. **Negative space:** enough intent to avoid nearby-but-wrong concepts.

Examples:

```bash
# Exact-ish title lookup
qmd search '"arm the rebels" merchants tools big companies' -c concepts

# Semantic concept lookup
qmd query $'intent: Find the customer proximity concept, not generic customer delight.\nlex: support pseudonymous merchant customer interviews\nvec: founder stays close to merchant reality through support and product use'

# Source lookup
qmd search "six-week cadence WhatsApp merchant relationships Shawn Ryan" -c sources -n 10
```

## Setup and maintenance

Only mutate indexes when the user asked for setup or maintenance. Searching and
retrieving are safe; collection/index mutation is not a casual first step.

```bash
npm install -g @tobilu/qmd
qmd collection add ~/notes --name notes
qmd update
qmd embed
```

Health and diagnostics:

```bash
qmd doctor
qmd status
qmd pull
```

`qmd doctor` checks config, model cache, device/GPU setup, vector fingerprints,
and common environment overrides. If a model-backed command fails, run it before
changing configuration.

## MCP setup

See `references/mcp-setup.md` for Claude Code, Claude Desktop, OpenClaw, and HTTP
server configuration.

## Pitfalls

- **Do not stop at snippets.** Fetch documents before making claims.
- **Do not slice files with `sed`/`head`/`tail`.** Use the `path:from:count`
  suffix (e.g. `qmd get "#abc123:120:40"`) or `--from`/`-l`. Output is already
  line-numbered; piping breaks docid resolution, the header, and virtual paths.
- **Do not lean on query expansion.** Write `intent:`/`lex:`/`vec:`/`hyde:`
  yourself. A bare `qmd query "user sentence"` discards the context only you
  have. You expand the query; the model just ranks.
- **Do not overuse semantic search.** If you know exact titles or terms, BM25 is
  faster and often better.
- **Do not mutate indexes casually.** `qmd collection add`, `qmd update`, and
  `qmd embed` change local state and can be expensive.
- **Model-backed commands can be environment-sensitive.** If `qmd query`,
  `qmd vsearch`, or reranking fails because local models/GPU are unavailable,
  use `qmd search` and stronger lexical/structured terms.
- **Ambiguous user wording needs intent.** Add `intent:` rather than hoping query
  expansion guesses the right domain.
- **Collection names matter.** Search `concepts` for synthesized wiki pages,
  `sources` for transcripts/raw source pages, and docs collections for code or
  project documentation.
