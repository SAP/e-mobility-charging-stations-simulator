# OCPP2 Mock Server

This project includes an Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) version 2.0.1 mock server implemented in Python.

## Prerequisites

This project requires Python 3.12+ (see `pyproject.toml`) and requires [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) 2+ to install the required packages.

```shell
pipx install poetry
```

Then install dependencies:

```shell
poetry install --no-root
```

## Running the Server

To start the server, run the `server.py` script:

```shell
poetry run task server
```

Or

```shell
poetry run python server.py
```

The server will start listening for connections on port 9000.

## Running the server with OCPP command sending

You can also specify a command and a period duration with the --command and --period options respectively when running the server. The server will then send your chosen command to the connected client(s) every period seconds.

### GetBaseReport Command

To run the server and send a GetBaseReport command every 5 seconds, use:

```shell
poetry run task server --command GetBaseReport --period 5
```

### ClearCache Command

To run the server and send a ClearCache command every 5 seconds, use:

```shell
poetry run task server --command ClearCache --period 5
```

Please be mindful that these commands were examples according to the provided scenario, the available commands and their syntax might vary depending on the ocpp version and the implemented functionalities on your client.

## Overview of the Server Scripts

### Server.py

The server script waits for connections from clients. When a client connects, the server creates a new instance of the `ChargePoint` class. This class includes methods for handling various OCPP messages, most of which return a dummy response.

The server script uses the `websockets` and `ocpp` libraries to facilitate the implementation.

## Development

### Code formatting

```shell
poetry run task format
```

### Code linting

```shell
poetry run task lint
```

## Note

Primarily, this software is intended for testing applications. The server script don't adhere to the full OCPP specifications and it is advised not to use them in a production environment without additional development.
