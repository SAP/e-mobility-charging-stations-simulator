  ## Project
  e-Mobility Charging Stations Simulator - Node.js software to simulate and scale
  charging stations based on the OCPP-J protocol as part of SAP e-Mobility solution.

  ## Tech Stack
  - Runtime: Node.js (>=22.0.0)
  - Language: TypeScript (strict mode)
  - Package Manager: pnpm (>=9.0.0)
  - Build Tool: esbuild
  - Testing: Node.js native test runner with @std/expect
  - Code Quality: ESLint, Prettier, neostandard

  ## OCPP Protocol Support
  - OCPP 1.6 (JSON/WebSocket)
  - OCPP 2.0.x (JSON/WebSocket)

  ## Architecture
  - src/charging-station/: Core charging station implementation
  - src/charging-station/ocpp/1.6/: OCPP 1.6 specific code
  - src/charging-station/ocpp/2.0/: OCPP 2.0.x specific code
  - src/types/: TypeScript type definitions
  - src/utils/: Utility functions
  - tests/: Test files mirroring source structure

  ## Key Conventions
  - Naming: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes/types/enums
  - Error handling: Use typed errors (BaseError, OCPPError), avoid generic Error
  - Null safety: Use optional chaining (?.) and nullish coalescing (??)
  - Type safety: Explicit types preferred, avoid 'any'
  - Async: Prefer async/await over raw Promises
  - OCPP: Follow standard naming exactly (e.g., RemoteStartTransaction, BootNotification)
  - Commits: Follow Conventional Commits format
  - Documentation: English only, concise, no marketing jargon

  ## Quality Gates
  - Build/lint/type checks must pass (pnpm build, pnpm lint, pnpm format)
  - Tests must pass (pnpm test)
  - PR titles follow Conventional Commits

# Per-artifact rules (optional)
# Add custom rules for specific artifacts.
# Example:
#   rules:
#     proposal:
#       - Keep proposals under 500 words
#       - Always include a "Non-goals" section
#     tasks:
#       - Break tasks into chunks of max 2 hours
